The help shows variables like `FROM_URL` or `MESSAGE`, which can
alternatively be provided by environment variables. For example:

```
$ FROM_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  FROM_TOKEN=glsa_FcOPTbFuJ9ZO0q6AzdTSoKjVLHaxsBw5_4ece1975 \
  TO_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  TO_TOKEN=glsa_sr9e9M1JI0ARODVP347uVKm7L1wqKvGa_3543afe4 \
  MESSAGE="Changes to the speed-check-panel." \
  active-grafana -c -r --board-uid=b3b41ced-1237-45a1-9f63-08d8b4191c57 \
  --board-folder-uid=afb10bf4-f0b1-4e2b-af04-1061844be119 \
  --rules-folder-uid=afb10bf4-f0b1-4e2b-af04-1061844be119
```

  FROM_TOKEN=glsa_FcOPTbFuJ9ZO0q6AzdTSoKjVLHaxsBw5_4ece1975 \
  TO_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  TO_TOKEN=glsa_sr9e9M1JI0ARODVP347uVKm7L1wqKvGa_3543afe4 \
  MESSAGE="Changes to the speed-check-panel." \
  lein run -- -c -r --board-uid=b3b41ced-1237-45a1-9f63-08d8b4191c57 \
  --board-folder-uid=afb10bf4-f0b1-4e2b-af04-1061844be119 \
  --rules-folder-uid=afb10bf4-f0b1-4e2b-af04-1061844be119
```

All variables can be found in `active-grafana.settings`.
