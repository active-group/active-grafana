## Usage

### Babashka

If you check out this repository you can use [babashka](https://book.babashka.org/).

This project contains two main-functions:

```
active-grafana.main-copy
active-grafana.main-adjust
```

With babaskha-tasks (see `bb.edn` or https://book.babashka.org/#tasks) you can start at the root of the project with:

```
active-grafana $ bb copy -h
```
or

```
active-grafana $ bb adjust -h
```

If this does not work try:

```
active-grafana $ bb -m active-grafana.main-copy -- -h
active-grafana $ bb -m active-grafana.main-adjust -- -h
```

The help shows variables like `URL`, `FROM_URL` or `MESSAGE`, which can
alternatively be provided by environment variables. For example:

```
$ export FROM_URL=http://localhost:3000
$ export FROM_TOKEN=glsa_FcOPTbFuJ9ZO0q6AzdTSoKjVLHaxsBw5_4ece1975
active-grafana $ TO_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
                 TO_TOKEN=glsa_sr9e9M1JI0ARODVP347uVKm7L1wqKvGa_3543afe4 \
                 MESSAGE="Changes to the speed-check-panel." \
                 bb -m active-grafana.main-copy -- \
                 -b -a --board-uid=b3b41ced-1237-45a1-9f63-08d8b4191c57 \
                 --board-folder-uid=afb10bf4-f0b1-4e2b-af04-1061844be119 \
                 --alerts-folder-uid=afb10bf4-f0b1-4e2b-af04-1061844be119
```

All variables can be found in `active-grafana.settings`.

image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/).

A usage example with [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Check out this repository as `active-grafana`.`

#### For copy:

## Known Issues and 'good to know'

- The application uses the environment variable `BABASHKA_POD` (as described
  [here](https://github.com/babashka/pods?tab=readme-ov-file#environment)) to
  determine, whether the application should behave as a pod.

- Error handling:
  If something goes wrong, you are immediately provided with the plain
  grafana-api-error-messages. Currently, there is no fallback or further help
  provided.

- Testing:
  There is no testing within the project.

- Logging and Debugging:
  The current logging and debugging system is rudimentary and might even be
  confusing.
